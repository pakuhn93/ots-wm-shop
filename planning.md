# What are we going to do?
- General: UI should include an output box with a set number of pulled items from a locally created database.

# Breakdown
- put an output box onto the screen
- use a dummy array to test our code
- import our data from the spreadsheet that we have, potentially even make a new file to hold the data
- filter the items by consumable (with mini category spell scroll) and permanent
- each item should be an object titled with its name
